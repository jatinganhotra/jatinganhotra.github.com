<BR>&nbsp;<BR>


<p>If you upgraded to OS X 10.9 Mavericks and have started to like the latest enhancements in Finder, new iBooks and Maps applications etc., installing Octave is going to make you forget all of it. The installation process is a herculean task and you better pray to God that you don&#8217;t run into much issues like I did.</p>

<p>I found decent help from here - <a href="http://ntraft.com/getting-octave-to-work-on-mountain-lion/">Getting Octave to Just Goddamn Work Already on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion</a>, thanks to <a href="http://ntraft.com">Neil Traft</a> for putting it together.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s only half of the story as you&#8217;ve upgraded to OS X 10.9 Mavericks. Here, I am writing down steps that you should follow in the exact order and also tips to solve issues all by yourself, if you run into any.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> <em>Please don&#8217;t ignore any warnings or any messages that you feel might be irrelevant. If one piece doesn&#8217;t fit well, the whole thing may fall later.</em></p>

<h4>1. Install the Xcode Command Line Tools</h4>

<p>Installing command line tools in OSX 10.9 Mavericks has changed slightly than previous versions of MAC OS X. Now you don&#8217;t have to install Xcode , you can install Command Line Tools stand alone.<br/>
Type <code>xcode-select --install</code> in terminal and choose <em>Install</em> option from the pop-up.<br/>
This may take some time depending on your Internet connection.</p>

<h4>2. Install Homebrew</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m assuming you know about Homebrew, but if you don&#8217;t do yourself a favor, my friend and install it by following <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation">Homebrew&#8217;s installation instructions</a>.</p>

<h4>3. Install XQuartz</h4>

<p>Install XQuartz from <a href="https://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">here</a>. In the past this came installed on OS X, but as of Mountain Lion it is no longer included. So go fix that.</p>

<h4>4. Updating and upgrading Homebrew</h4>

<p>If you had Homebrew installed already, update to the latest package definitions. Don&#8217;t skip this step out of mere laziness.<br/>
<code>$ brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade</code><br/>
This may take some time. So, go get yourself a cup of coffee and better have some beer. The path ahead could be tough.</p>

<h4>5. Import the scientific computing packages</h4>

<p><code>$ brew tap homebrew/science</code><br/>
If you see any warnings here, run <code>brew doctor</code> and follow what it says. Let me repeat. Don&#8217;t be smart and just do what the doctor says!!! The doctor is always right.<br/>
Once you have followed the steps specifed by <code>brew doctor</code>, run<br/>
<code>$ brew untap homebrew/science</code> and rerun<br/>
<code>$ brew tap homebrew/science</code>.</p>

<h4>6. Install gfortran</h4>

<p>To install Octave, you have to install <code>gfortran</code> first.<br/>
<code>$ brew install gfortran</code><br/>
Pay close attention to any messages and warnings during the install. If everything looks good, jump to the next Step.</p>

<p>If you see any warnings like: <code>/usr/bin/install_name tool: malformed object (unknown load command)</code>,<br/>
go and visit this <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/25665">Github issue</a> that I raised for more details.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re facing any other problem:<br/>
  * run <code>brew doctor</code> first and do what the doctor says!!!<br/>
  * Re-run the command again and see if the issue got resolved.<br/>
  * If not, go ahead and raise a new issue at <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues">Homebrew Issues</a>.</p>

<h4>7. Installing Octave</h4>

<p><code>$ brew install octave</code><br/>
If everything looks good, jump to the next Step.</p>

<p>If brew complains about not having a formula for octave, the following command should fix it:
<code>$ brew tap --repair</code></p>

<p>If you get an error like <code>do a web search for TeX and your operating system. make[3]: *** [octave.dvi] Error 1</code> then build with<br/>
<code>$ brew install octave --without-docs</code> option.<br/>
(<em>Thanks Pierre and Kahini for the correction about <code>--without-docs</code>, previously <code>-without-docs</code></em>).</p>

<p>This is because you don&#8217;t have the Tex package installed. Alternatively, you can also download the 2.3GB <em>MacTeX.pkg</em> from <a href="http://tug.org/mactex/">here</a>, install it and rerun the install command.<br/>
(<strong>Update:</strong> Don&#8217;t try this !!! I installed MacTex package but the Octave installation still failed. I raised an issue here - <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/issues/796">Homebrew-science Issues</a> but with no help.)</p>

<p>If you run into any other issue, run <code>brew doctor</code> first and do what the doctor says!!! Re-run the command again and   see if the issue got resolved. If not, go ahead and raise a new issue at <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/issues">Homebrew-science Issues</a>.</p>

<h4>8. Install gnuplot</h4>

<p>For native drawing support, we&#8217;ll install gnuplot.<br/>
<code>$ brew install gnuplot</code><br/>
(<strong>Update:</strong> As <em>phseven</em> pointed out, gnuplot will be automatically installed with octave, but in some cases it won&#8217;t support X11.) For such cases, do the following:<br/>
<code>$ brew uninstall gnuplot</code><br/>
<code>$ brew install gnuplot --with-x</code></p>

<h4>9. Setup Octave startup file</h4>

<p>Edit your Octave startup file or create a new one:<br/>
<code>$ vim ~/.octaverc</code> and add the line <code>setenv GNUTERM x11</code>.<br/>
Don&#8217;t forget to save the file.</p>

<h4>10. Create a launcher app with Applescript [<em>Optional</em>]</h4>

<p>Open the &#8220;AppleScript Editor&#8221; application and write the following text in the editor window:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>tell application "Terminal"
</span><span class='line'> do script "`which octave`; exit"
</span><span class='line'>end tell</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Save it as an application &#8216;Octave.app&#8217; and then navigate it to the &#8220;Applications&#8221; folder.</p>

<p>Now for the ultimate fix: Reboot your machine!!! Yep, until you restart your Mac, Octave will be unable to launch XQuartz on its own, and you won&#8217;t be able to plot anything.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;re back in, open the terminal, fire up Octave, and plot a <em>sombrero()</em>.<strong> You&#8217;re all set!!!</strong></p>

<p>This is a small and crisp post over this warning message that appeared quite strange at first. On a closer look though, the reason behind it was pretty clear and straight-forward.</p>

<blockquote><p>warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type</p></blockquote>

<p>I was just playing around with <code>string.find()</code> function, when I got this warning message.
Here is a simple piece of code which, when run on a 64-bit architecture, will produce the above warning.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">subject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;A[1]&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">search</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="n">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">subject</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">search</span><span class="p">);</span>    <span class="c1">// location is unsigned</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">location</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">npos</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">&quot; true&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">&quot; false&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The catch here is that <code>std::string::npos</code> returns <code>size_t</code>, which represents the unsigned native integer size on current architecture.<br/>
So, on a 32-bit architecture:<br/>
 - both <code>unsigned</code> and <code>size_t</code> would have the same size,<br/>
However, on a 64-bit machine:<br/>
 - the <code>unsigned</code> would be size - 4 and <code>size_t</code> would be size - 8.<br/>
Hence, the comparison would be always false when run on a 64-bit machine.</p>

<p>So, the proper fix for the above code is to make location variable of type <strong>size_t</strong>.</p>

<p>For more information on <code>size_t</code>, refer to my blog post on <a href="http://jatinganhotra.com/blog/2012/08/25/integer-limits-and-types-in-c-cpp/">Integer Limits and Types in C/C++</a> , which explains the sizes of basic C++ types.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> If you&#8217;re seeing the same warning message, but not around the <code>string.find()</code> function, try <strong>StackOverflow</strong> for help. The warning message is generic and can occur at places where a comparison is being done between types of different sizes.</p>

<p>As a software developer, I spend about 6-8 hours typing on a typical day. My search for a better keyboard began, when I started having wrist pain and my fingers felt enervated after a few hours. On doing some research, I found that these are the symptoms of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">Repetitive Strain Injury(RSI)</a>. Other than maintaining a good posture while sitting, I started investigating keyboards which allowed writing with ease and placed my wrists in a comfortable position.</p>

<p>Many questions and articles such as:<br/>
 - <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/2266">Programmers Stack Exchange - What are good keyboards for programming?</a><br/>
 - <a href="https://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/What-is-the-best-keyboard-for-a-programmer">Quora - What-is-the-best-keyboard-for-a-programmer</a></p>

<p>led me to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/B2M-00012">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jatinganhotra.com/images/Microsoft_Natural_Ergonomic_keyboard.jpg" title="Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard" ></p>

<p><strong>Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</strong> is an ergonomic split-style keyboard which allows you to rest your wrists against the plush palm rest in a relaxed, natural angle with this keyboard’s curved key bed, ergonomic arc and reversed slope. The wrist pad is made of a nicely textured faux leather material with a tiny bit of padding which feels both comfortable and durable.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jatinganhotra.com/images/Microsoft_Natural_Ergonomic_keyboard_reverse_slope.jpg" title="Reverse Slope" ><br/>
The <em>reverse slope</em> helps your hand and wrist rest more naturally. You can use the keyboard in the reversed slope position or with the front riser, depending on which of the two positions align your wrist perfectly.</p>

<p>Apart from comfort, there are quick and customizable ways to reach files, folders, and web pages with handy hot keys. Yes, the keyboard does come with software for the programmable keys and extra functions. Sadly, not for Linux versions e.g CentOS, due to which I haven’t been able to customize it further at work. The natural alignment of wrists and fingers has given me so much relief that I&#8217;ve never felt that I&#8217;m missing out on a lot of customisations that it provides. I do plan to try it out with my Macbook Pro sometime and look at the customisations being offered.</p>

<p>However, there is one area where the keyboard can definitely improve. The space key is a little bit stiff, especially when pressed around the corners. I’ve got used to it over time and so would any other user, but it’s just that, it irks you sometimes as you have to press it again.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s a very high quality keyboard and anyone that spends a significant amount of time working with computers will be able to appreciate the keyboard just after 1-2 days of adjustment. I&#8217;m very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this keyboard to my fellow programmers :)</p>

<p>If you’re thinking of purchasing it, rush to the link <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Natural-Ergonomic-Keyboard-4000/dp/B000A6PPOK/ref=pd_sim_e_5">Amazon - Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a>. Amazon is offering a huge 15$ discount, avail it while it lasts.</p>

<p>I was flabbergasted when I went to my <a href="http://jatinganhotra.com">Tech Blog</a> yesterday and looked over at the <strong>ads</strong> in the
&#8217;<em>Comments</em>&#8217; section powered by <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://jatinganhotra.com/images/Disqus_Discovery_Ads.png" width="650" height="200" title="Disqus Discovery Ads" ></p>

<p><strong>Disqus</strong>, how could you? Come on.!!<br/>
I don&#8217;t want ads on my blog. I hate ads. Now I have to remove you. But where will I turn? Fortunately, there&#8217;s a way this <strong>New Promoted Discovery</strong> can be turned off. Phew !! :)</p>

<br/>


<p><img class="right" src="http://jatinganhotra.com/images/Disqus_Discovery_settings.png" width="500" height="150" title="Disqus Discovery Settings" >
Head over to the <em>Discovery Settings</em> and you can choose among the 4 levels as per your needs.<br/>
I chose <strong>Just Comments</strong>.</p>

<br/>


<br/>


<p>While searching for alternatives, I tried my hands on <a href="http://www.intensedebate.com/"><strong>Intense Debate</strong></a>, but the whole UI and the login system wasn&#8217;t great as compared to Disqus. For instance, Disqus shows a minimalistic and simplified dialog, with options to login via Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Disqus.</p>

<p>This is a brief post for beginners to Verilog language, coming from a C/Java background.
Verilog  differs from a conventional programming language in the sense that the execution of statements is not strictly sequential. Different code blocks are executed concurrently as opposed to the sequential execution of most programming languages. So, a beginner might get  perplexed, as to what is concurrent and what is not !!</p>

<h3>Concurrent Statements:</h3>

<p>All statements in Verilog are concurrent (unless they are inside a sequential block as discussed later). Concurrent means that the operations described in each line take place in parallel.
The commonly used concurrent constructs are gate instantiation and the continuous assignment statement.</p>

<p>Note that no net should be assigned a value more than once with concurrent statements.e.g<br/>
<code>assign sum = a + b + c;</code><br/>
can be re-written as<br/>
<code>assign sum = a + b;</code><br/>
<code>assign sum = sum + c;</code><br/>
but, although equivalent sequentially, it’s incorrect as both statements are concurrent, so the value of sum is indeterminate.</p>

<h3>Sequential Statements:</h3>

<p>Sequential statements are similar to statements in a normal programming language. A sequence of statements is regarded as describing operations that take place one after the other instead of at the same time.</p>

<ul>
<li>All sequential Verilog statements must be inside a procedural block.</li>
<li>Sequential statements are placed inside a begin/end block and executed in sequential order within the block. However, the blocks themselves are executed concurrently.</li>
<li>Verilog statements outside any process block are interpreted as concurrent statements and different procedural blocks execute concurrently.</li>
</ul>


<p>The commonly used sequential constructs are:<br/>
* <em>Initial</em> and <em>always</em> procedural blocks: <em>Initial</em> blocks start execution at time zero and execute only once. Always blocks loop to execute over and over again, and as the name suggests, they execute always.<br/>
* <em>if, case</em> structures, <em>for and while loops</em>: Always appear inside an always block.<br/>
Note that multiple assignment of values is allowed inside a procedural block.</p>

<p>Recently, I encountered a strange compiler error at work. I was trying something similar to this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">var1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">func1</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">var2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">func2</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">// Use var1 and var2 here - Doesn&#39;t compile }</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>but, it didn&#8217;t compile. So, I played my Jedi debugging tricks to see
what exactly went wrong?<br/>
To my surprise,</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">var2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">func2</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">)</span>  <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">//... } // Doesn&#39;t compile, note the extra () </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">var2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">func2</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span>      <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">//... } // Compiles just fine !!!</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, it was well clear that <code>()</code> was the pith of the error.<br/>
To strengthen my understanding, I tried some more cases with <code>()</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The results were affirmative. So, I went to check the C++ Standard.<br/>
The syntax specification in 6.4/1 gives the following for selection condition:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>selection-statement:
</span><span class='line'>if ( condition ) statement
</span><span class='line'>    condition: 
</span><span class='line'>        expression
</span><span class='line'>        type-specifier-seq declarator = assignment-expression
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>// The declarator shall not specify a function or an array.
</span><span class='line'>// The type-specifier-seq shall not contain typedef and shall not declare a new class or enumeration.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The condition in an if or while statement can be either an expression, or a single variable declaration (with initialisation).</p>

<p>The failing examples are neither valid statements, nor valid declarations, since a declaration can&#8217;t form part of an expression. The syntax specification says a single declaration, with no parentheses or other adornments and they don&#8217;t fit the &#8220;either expression or declaration&#8221; rule for the condition.</p>

<p>So, to sum it up, the <strong>rules for variable declaration in a selection-statement</strong> are:</p>

<ol>
<li>can only have 1 variable declared per expression,</li>
<li>the variable declaration must occur first in the expression and</li>
<li>can&#8217;t have parenthesis around declaration ( as per the syntax specification)</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Q</strong>. <em>Why the variable declaration must occur first, and why can we have only 1 variable declared?</em><br/>
<strong>A:</strong> Short-circuit evaluation of logic and the declared variable(s) scope. Consider this case:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">val</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">//... }    // what should &quot;a&quot; be initialized to? </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator is a <em>short-circuit logical AND</em>. As the first part 0 is false, then the second part <code>(int a = val)</code> shouldn&#8217;t be evaluated because the final answer will be false. If it isn&#8217;t evaluated, then what to do with code later on that uses a? Should we initialize the variable and leave it undefined?</p>

<p>For these reasons, the variable declaration must be first in the expression and the rules for variable declaration in a selection-statement stated above hold.</p>

</div>


<BR>&nbsp;<BR>


<p>Most countries in the world have English as their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_where_English_is_an_official_language">official language</a>, but there are many countries where people <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:English-as-Official-Language_Map.png">don&#8217;t know English</a>. So, it&#8217;s good to have a website translator if people from such countries visit your blog. This article will show you how to add <a href="http://translate.google.com/manager/website/">Google Website Translator</a> to your <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blog.</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> <a href="http://googletranslate.blogspot.in/2012/05/now-you-can-polish-up-googles.html">announced in a post</a> on their <a href="http://googletranslate.blogspot.in/">Google translate blog</a> that they are introducing a beta website translator for blogs and websites.  Google translate currently works over 60 languages.  Once you add the customization meta tag to a webpage, visitors will see your customized translations whenever they translate the page, even when they use the feature in <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/chrome/browser/features.html">Chrome</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/toolbar/ie/index.html">Google Toolbar</a>. They’ll also now be able to &#8217;<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2007/03/suggest-better-translation.html">suggest a better translation</a>&#8217; when they notice a translation that’s not quite right, and later you can accept and use that suggestion on your site.</p>

<p>For more information about better translation and suggestion, refer <a href="http://translate.google.com/manager/website/">here</a>. You can follow these easy steps to add Google Website Translator to your Octopress blog:</p>

<h4>Step 1 : Get <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>&#8217;s which the Website Translator plugin uses</h4>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://translate.google.com/manager/website/">Google Website Translator</a> and sign in with your Google account.</li>
<li>Enter the URL for your website and the original language of your website.</li>
<li>You can customize the plugin settings like <em>Translation languages (all/specific)</em>, <em>Display modes (Inline/Tabbed/Automatic)</em> etc. and whether you want to track Translation Traffic using Google Analytics.</li>
<li>Google translate will give you a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag and a <code>code snippet</code> with <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Step 2 : Use the above snippet in your Octopress blog</h4>

<ol>
<li>Create a file <code>google_translate.html</code> in <code>source/_includes/</code>.</li>
<li>Add the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag and the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to this file.</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;meta name="google-translate-customization" content="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    function googleTranslateElementInit() {
</span><span class='line'>        new google.translate.TranslateElement({
</span><span class='line'>              pageLanguage: 'en', 
</span><span class='line'>              layout: google.translate.TranslateElement.InlineLayout.SIMPLE,
</span><span class='line'>              gaTrack: true,
</span><span class='line'>              gaId: 'UA-ABCDEFGH'},
</span><span class='line'>         'google_translate_element');
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/script&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://jatinganhotra.com//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you observe carefully, you can look at the values of the parameters that you set when you got the code. e.g. I&#8217;m using <em>inline</em> styling with <em>Simple</em> layout and Google Analytics to track translation traffic.<br/>
3. Add the following line where you want to display the plugin.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;div id="google_translate_element"&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>
4. Include <code>google_translate.html</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag in the file <code>source/_includes/head.html</code>, like <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/blob/master/.themes/classic/source/_includes/head.html#L28">this</a>.<br/>
5. Run <code>rake generate ; rake preview</code> to play with it locally on your machine.</p>

    <link href="http://jatinganhotra.com/blog/2012/11/25/forward-class-declaration-in-c-plus-plus/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-25T21:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://jatinganhotra.com/blog/2012/11/25/forward-class-declaration-in-c-plus-plus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coming+Soon&subset=latin,latin-ext' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'></p>

<div>
<span style="float:right;" id="google_translate_element"></span>
<span style="float:right; font-family: 'Coming Soon', cursive;">Having trouble viewing in English, Choose Your Language : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</div>


<BR>&nbsp;<BR>


<p>&#8220;In computer programming, a <a href="%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_declaration">forward declaration</a> is a declaration of an identifier (denoting an entity such as a type, a variable, or a function) for which the programmer has not yet given a complete definition.&#8221;</p>

<p>In C++, you should forward declare classes instead of including headers. Don&#8217;t use an #include when a forward declaration would suffice.
When you include a header file you introduce a dependency that will cause your code to be recompiled whenever the header file changes. If your header file includes other header files, any change to those files will cause any code that includes your header to be recompiled. Therefore, you should prefer to minimize includes, particularly includes of header files in other header files.</p>

<p>You can significantly reduce the number of header files you need to include in your own header files by using forward declarations. For example, if your header file uses the File class in ways that do not require access to the declaration of the File class, your header file can just forward declare class File; instead of having to #include &#8220;file.h&#8221;.</p>

<p>This will in turn speed a little bit the compilation.</p>

<p><strong>When can I use the forward class declaration?</strong><br/>
Put yourself in the compiler&#8217;s position: when you forward declare a type, all the compiler know is that this type exists; it knows nothing about its size, members or methods. This is why it&#8217;s called an <em>incomplete type</em>. Therefore, you cannot use the <em>incomplete</em> type at places where the compiler would need to know the layout of the type.</p>

<p>Assuming the following forward declaration
<code>class Forward;</code></p>

<p><strong>You can use forward declarations in all the following cases, where</strong></p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4144783.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>class Master {
private:
    // Declare a member to be a pointer or a reference to the incomplete type
    Forward *ptr1;     
    Forward &amp;ptr2;

public:

    // Declare functions or methods which accepts/return incomplete types:
    void ByValue(Forward by_value);
    Forward OrReturnValue();

    // Define functions or methods which accepts/return pointers/references 
    // to the incomplete type (but without using its members):
    void OrByPointer(Forward* by_pointer);
    void OrByReference(const Forward&amp; by_reference);
    Forward&amp; ReturnByRef();
    Forward* ReturnByPointer();

};</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p><strong>You can&#8217;t use forward declarations in all the following cases, where</strong></p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4144778.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>// Use it as a base class
class Master : Forward {} // compiler error!

// Use it to declare a member:
class Master {
    Forward cannot_define_obj_member; // compiler error!
};

// Define functions or methods using the incomplete type
void SomeFunc1(Forward x) {} // compiler error!
Forward    SomeFunc2()    {} // compiler error!

// Use its methods or fields, in fact trying to dereference a variable with incomplete type
class Master {
    Forward *forward_class_ptr;            
    void SomeFunc()            
    {
        forward_class_ptr-&gt;SomeMethod();      // compiler error!
        int i = forward_class_ptr-&gt;SomeField; // compiler error!
    }
};

// Whenever you use a class as a template parameter, the declaration of that class must be complete and not simply forward declared.
class Master {
      std::vector&lt;Forward&gt; some_stl_containers_;
};


// Delete the forward declared class in the module
class Forward;
class Master
{
    void SomeFunc(Forward* forward_class_ptr)
    {
        delete forward_class_ptr;
    }
};
// From the C++ standard: 5.3.5/5:
// &quot;If the object being deleted has incomplete class type at the point of deletion and the complete class has a // non-trivial destructor or a deallocation function, the behavior is undefined.&quot;
// e.g gcc 4.2.1 errors out and reports a note: neither the destructor nor the class-specific operator delete will be called, even if they are declared when the class is defined.

<p>I recently delivered a presentation on <em><strong> Why use GIT and leave CVS </strong></em>.
It covers various aspects where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">CVS</a> is a total failure, thus stressing upon the need to change.</p>

<p>Then, I touched upon the history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">Version Control Systems</a>, show-casing how they have evolved over the time, and under which category do CVS and GIT fall.</p>

<p>With the staze set then, I covered some basic <a href="http://git-scm.com">GIT</a> commands, explained the GIT architecture, how it works under-the-hood and showed some GIT coolness.</p>

<p>Here is the presentation. Enjoy! :)</p>

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>


<p>Unlike <a href="http://java.com/en/">Java</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language">C#</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type">primitive data types</a> in C++ can vary in size depending on the platform. For example, int is not guaranteed to be a 32-bit integer. The size of basic C++ types depends on</p>

<ul>
<li><h3><strong>The Architecture</strong> (16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits) and</h3></li>
</ul>


<p>You can expect <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/size_t">std::size_t</a> to always represent the unsigned native integer size on current architecture. i.e. 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit. e.g<br/>
On a x64-bit machine, with <em>x86_64</em> hardware-platform and processor,
<code>sizeof(std::size_t) == sizeof(unsigned int) == 8 </code><br/>
where as, on a 32-bit machine, with <em>i386</em> hardware-platform and <em>i686</em> processor,
<code>sizeof(std::size_t) == sizeof(unsigned int) == 4 </code><br/>
But as far as all the other built-in types go, it really depends on the compiler.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3><strong>The Compiler</strong></h3></li>
</ul>


<p>The C++ standard does not specify the size of integral types in bytes, but it specifies minimum ranges they must be able to hold. You can infer minimum size in bits from the required range and the value of <code>CHAR_BIT</code> macro in &lt;<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/climits">climits</a>>, that defines the number of bits in a byte (in all but the most obscure platforms it&#8217;s 8).<br/>
<em>An important point</em> to note for <code>char</code> is that its size is always 1 byte, or <code>CHAR_BIT</code> bits (hence the name). char is always a byte , but it&#8217;s not always an octet. <em>A byte is the smallest addressable unit of memory (in most definitions), an octet is 8-bit unit of memory.</em>
i.e <code>sizeof(char) == 1</code> for all implementations, but <code>CHAR_BIT</code> defines the size of a byte for a platform and it&#8217;s not always 8 bit. There are platforms with 16-bit and 32-bit bytes, hence char will take up more than 8 bits, but it is still a byte.</p>

<p>A C++ (or C) implementation can define the size of a type in bytes <code>sizeof(type)</code> to any value, as long as</p>

<ol>
<li>the expression <code>sizeof(type) * CHAR_BIT</code> evaluates to the number of bits enough to contain required ranges, and</li>
<li>the ordering of type is still valid (e.g. <code>sizeof(int) &lt;= sizeof(long)</code>).</li>
</ol>


<p>The actual implementation-specific ranges can be found in &lt;<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/limits.h.html">limits.h</a>> header in C, or &lt;<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/climits">climits</a>> in C++ (or even better, templated <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits">std::numeric_limits</a> in &lt;<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/limits">limits</a>> header).
Minimum ranges <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">required by the standard</a> (page 22) can be found using this C++ snippet:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/4368027">GIST - C++ snippet - Listing of MIN/MAX values, attributes of Integral Types</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Portability</strong></h3>

<p>If you are concerned with portability and want guaranteed size, or you want the name of the type reflects the size,</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use the header <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1%5F40%5F0/libs/integer/cstdint.htm">BOOST cstdint</a>. It&#8217;s usually better than inventing your own wheel(which incurs the maintainence and testing), or</li>
<li>You can use the header &lt;<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/libstdc++-html-USERS-4.2/cinttypes-source.html">cinttypes</a>>, where the following macros are available: <code>int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t</code> etc.<br/>
