I was flabbergasted when I went to my [Tech Blog](http://jatinganhotra.com) yesterday and looked over at the **ads** in the
'_Comments_' section powered by [Disqus](http://disqus.com/).

**Disqus**, how could you? Come on.!!  
I don't want ads on my blog. I hate ads. Now I have to remove you. But where will I turn? But, there's a way this **New Promoted Discovery** can be turned off. Phew !! :)

Head over to the _Discovery Settings_ and you can choose among the 4 levels as per your needs.  
I chose **Just Comments**.

While searching for alternatives, I tried my hands on [**Intense Debate**](http://www.intensedebate.com/), but the whole UI and the login system wasn't great as compared to Disqus. For instance, Disqus shows a minimalistic and simplified dialog, with options to login via Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Disqus.

If Disqus plans to make these _Discovery Ads_ permanent in future, I
plan to switch over to **IntenseDebate**, but I urge you to enhance the
login options. My 2 cents :)
