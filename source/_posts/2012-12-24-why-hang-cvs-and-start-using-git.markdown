I recently delivered a presentation on _** Why use GIT and leave CVS **_.
It covers various aspects where [CVS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) is a total failure, thus stressing upon the need to change.  

Then, I touched upon the history of [Version Control Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control), show-casing how they have evolved over the time, and under which category do CVS and GIT fall.  

With the staze set then, I covered some basic [GIT](http://git-scm.com) commands, explained the GIT architecture, how it works under-the-hood and showed some GIT coolness.

Here is the presentation. Enjoy! :)
