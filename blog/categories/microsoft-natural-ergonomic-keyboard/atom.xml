<p>As a software developer, I spend about 6-8 hours typing on a typical day. My search for a better keyboard began, when I started having wrist pain and my fingers felt enervated after a few hours. On doing some research, I found that these are the symptoms of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">Repetitive Strain Injury(RSI)</a>. Other than maintaining a good posture while sitting, I started investigating keyboards which allowed writing with ease and placed my wrists in a comfortable position.</p>

<p>Many questions and articles such as:<br/>
 - <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/2266">Programmers Stack Exchange - What are good keyboards for programming?</a><br/>
 - <a href="https://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/What-is-the-best-keyboard-for-a-programmer">Quora - What-is-the-best-keyboard-for-a-programmer</a></p>

<p>led me to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/B2M-00012">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/Microsoft_Natural_Ergonomic_keyboard.jpg" title="Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard" ></p>

<p><strong>Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</strong> is an ergonomic split-style keyboard which allows you to rest your wrists against the plush palm rest in a relaxed, natural angle with this keyboard’s curved key bed, ergonomic arc and reversed slope. The wrist pad is made of a nicely textured faux leather material with a tiny bit of padding which feels both comfortable and durable.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/Microsoft_Natural_Ergonomic_keyboard_reverse_slope.jpg" title="Reverse Slope" ><br/>
The <em>reverse slope</em> helps your hand and wrist rest more naturally. You can use the keyboard in the reversed slope position or with the front riser, depending on which of the two positions align your wrist perfectly.</p>

<p>Apart from comfort, there are quick and customizable ways to reach files, folders, and web pages with handy hot keys. Yes, the keyboard does come with software for the programmable keys and extra functions. Sadly, not for Linux versions e.g CentOS, due to which I haven’t been able to customize it further at work. The natural alignment of wrists and fingers has given me so much relief that I've never felt that I'm missing out on a lot of customisations that it provides. I do plan to try it out with my Macbook Pro sometime and look at the customisations being offered.</p>

<p>However, there is one area where the keyboard can definitely improve. The space key is a little bit stiff, especially when pressed around the corners. I’ve got used to it over time and so would any other user, but it’s just that, it irks you sometimes as you have to press it again.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s a very high quality keyboard and anyone that spends a significant amount of time working with computers will be able to appreciate the keyboard just after 1-2 days of adjustment. I'm very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this keyboard to my fellow programmers :)</p>

<p>If you’re thinking of purchasing it, rush to the link <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Natural-Ergonomic-Keyboard-4000/dp/B000A6PPOK/ref=pd_sim_e_5">Amazon - Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a>. Amazon is offering a huge 15$ discount, avail it while it lasts.</p>
